<h1> Function/How to use </h1>
Currently it's just like. a music file uploader. Upload any mp3, wav, or m4a and it'll get stored in a variable. Because it's not done. But yeah that's the current functionality lol

<h1>Other</h1>
<h5>App that imitates burning CDs for your friends. Decently ambiitous for me; currently using Typescript instead of vanilla JS, going to have to learn NodeJS and how to use AWS for backend, as well as learn and integrate JS frameworks like React just for funsies. Obv a big fat WIP. So yeah!</h6>
